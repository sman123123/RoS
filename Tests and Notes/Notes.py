    #Basic Attributes
        #Brawn - (BN) is a measure of your muscle, your vitality, or your frame. It indicates how much damage you can do unaided, and how easily you resist punishment, disease, and poison.
        #Daring - (DG) is a measure of your courage and ability to take decisive action. It affects how well you can strike and parry, as well as how skilled you are with actions like climbing, acrobatics and all kinds of athletics.
        #Tenacity - (TY) is a measure of your ability to focus on a task or goal, a meter of the strength of your persona. It affects how easily influenced you are, your inner discipline, and your sanity.
        #Heart - (HT) is a measure of your social aptitude. It affects both how charismatic you appear to others (people and animals) and how easily you can get them to do your bidding. It governs your ability for empathy, and the understanding of human and animal nature.
        #Sagacity - (SY) is a measure of your mental agility. It indicates how logical, intuitive, and smart you are. It affects situations that require reasoning, sharpness of the senses, as well as any judgment relating to them.

#Proficiencies
    #Brawling - Brawling consists first and foremost of punching and kicking, derived by means of the Bash Maneuver, but also of grappling and plenty of dirty tricks.
    #Cut and Thrust - This proficiency refers to swords that are usually not wielded in conjuction with a larger shield, but rather in quick fencing style.
    #Dagger - Found in every place in the world, daggers and knives are used as both tools and instruments of death.
    #Greatsword - Frequently wielded with a wide, half-swording grip. Greatswords are fearsome weapons with great range, but easily overcome by any fighter agile enough to get close.
    #Longsword - For those warriors that prefer not to use shields, longswords are very polular. They are a fierce weapon, capable of heavy damage when either cleaving or thrusting, as well as complex maneuvering and countering.
    #Mass Weapon and Shield - Mass weapons include any single-handed (and occasionally two-handed) weapon that is particularly heavy on the end. These weapon's balance makes them slow on the parry and commends the use of constant evasion or - more commonly - shields.
    #Missile Weapon Proficiencies
    #Pole-Arms - A wide range of weapons from the Spear to the Halberd.
    #Spear and Shield - Covers the use of one-handed spears and shields.
    #Sword and Shield - This Proficiency involves any one-handed sword and a shield. Although this proficiency could be used without a shield at no penalty.
    #Wrestling - As with Brawling, Wrestling is always an option for the unarmed character.
